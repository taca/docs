# Autoloading Contao 4 or Symfony bundles

Contao 4 is a full-featured Symfony application. Extending a Symfony application
is accomplished using so-called *bundles*, which can extend the configuration
at compilation-time. [Read more](http://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles.html) 
about bundles in the Symfony manual.

Because Contao *Managed Edition* does not know what bundles exist and in what
order they must be loaded, the Manager Plugin needs to tell that to the 
application.
