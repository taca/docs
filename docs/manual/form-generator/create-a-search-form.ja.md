As already mentioned in the section [My Search Forms](/ja/layout/module-management/website-search/#own-search-forms), you 
can use the form generator to create your own search form and include it in the header of your website, as an example. 
You only need to perform the following steps:

1. Open the form generator, and create [a new form](/ja/form-generator/forms/#form-configuration). Specify 
the search page as the redirect page, and select *GET* as the transfer method.
2. Add a [text field](/ja/form-generator/form-fields/#text-field) to the form, and enter the field `keywords` name. 
If you prefer, you can make this field mandatory, because a search without a search term will probably not yield many results.
3. Optionally add a [radio button menu](/ja/form-generator/form-fields/#radio-button-menu) to the form if you 
want your visitor to be able to choose between AND and OR search. The field name is in this case `query_type` with the 
option values `and` and `or`.
4. Add a [submit button](/ja/form-generator/form-fields/#submit-field) to the form.

This will create a working search form, and you can embed it as a frontend module in the page layout in the header or 
any other column of your website.
